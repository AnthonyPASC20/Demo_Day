                <p>I was born and raised in New York City. The city of course doesnt need a introduction. I'm just one of the gears that turn in the city of eight million! My hobbies include playing video games, volleyball and fixing phones! Minecraft was the first computer game I ever played and from thier I was more interested in technology. I have a youtube channel but it's not the most family friendly content XD.</p>

                <p>School has always been an important part of my life. I've made amazing friends like those in picture above. I also have made great connections with many amazing teachers. My favorite subjects in school are science related, I was able to build a drone with parts that the school brought for me. Even though the school day drags on for 8 hours I realized now with Covid, that I miss it!</p>
